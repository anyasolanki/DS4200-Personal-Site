    <p id = 'main'>Here is a short introduction about me:</p>
    <p class = 'A'> 
        My name is Anya Solanki, and I am currently a junior majoring in Data Science and Economics. I have always been drawn to numbers, patterns, and problem-solving, which led me to pursue data science, while my interest in financial systems and market behavior made economics a natural pairing. My academic journey has been shaped by hands-on learning experiences, including my co-op at Dell Technologies, where I worked on data analytics and process automation. I will also be working as a data engineer intern at Amazon this summer, which challenged me to deepen my understanding of data warehousing and SQL.  
        
        Beyond academics and work, I enjoy painting, baking, and watching movies. I find creativity to be a great balance to my analytical work, and I love spending time with friends and family, including my dog, Coco. Another area of interest for me is the ethical implications of AI, which I explored in my cybersecurity class last semester. AI is a powerful tool, but its impact on privacy, security, and fairness is often overlooked, which is why I enjoy discussing its broader implications. I look forward to learning more about AI, data science, and their applications in different industries.</p>
